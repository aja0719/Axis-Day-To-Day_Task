******************Design Pattern In Software Engineering*******************
 Design Pattern
    It help us to represent any type of code in a better way,
      which results in Development easier and understandable to other developers.

      At the time of Substitutional period of Development developers will face issues to follow the approach.
      It supports object oriented coding approach.

     -We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
     -Design patterns ease the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC by providing information based on prior hands-on experiences
     -By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable. 

      Gang of Fours Patterns (GOF)
      It is introduced by 4 Engrs 
       Erich Gamma , Johson , Richard , John Vlisside
    
    -Interface concepts and its immplementation


    There are two types of categories of Design Patterns
    1. Core Java (JSE) 
    2. JEE Design Patterns


    In Core Java (JSE) Design Patterns are
     1. Creational Design Pattern
       It help us to the way of creating objects,hide that objects,clone of that object.

      There are 6 types of Creational Design Patterns are followed by

      1.Singleton 
          It deals with only creating on object and that can be used in multiple clsses.
            
                =>simplest patterns in Creational patterns ,it's one of most commonly used patterns
                =>singleton patterns which will handle the creation of object,
                  it will help us make sure that each class in your project must have only one object 
                =>it will infom that each class which we say that as singleton class the constructor of that class will be private ,and make the instance of that class to be static
   ***********************************************************************************************   
      task1 create class bank make this bank class ass single turn (method's bankstatus(open or closed))  method bankstatus(time){check the time is <9-18>}
       create class called checkBank which have to be use singleton bank object to check bank status by passing the time
****************************************************************************************************
  
     2.Factory method Pattern
          - A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define 
            an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide 
             which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
